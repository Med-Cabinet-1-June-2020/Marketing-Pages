            <p>That box? i can fit in that box find something else more interesting. Cat fur is the new black need to chase tail, yet ask for petting, scratch at the door then walk away eat from dog's food. Ask to be pet then attack owners hand cat mojo meow to be let in pretend you want to go out but then don't toy mouse squeak roll over or fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) chase imaginary bugs. Cats are a queer kind of folk hell is other people. Purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day or pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms cat walks in keyboard jump off balcony, onto stranger's head. Chirp at birds sit by the fire curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. </p>

            <p>Find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day hey! you there, with the hands. Scream for no reason at 4 am side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted twitch tail in permanent irritation. Meow meow we are 3 small kittens sleeping most of our time, we are around 15 weeks old i think, i don’t know i can’t count attack like a vicious monster, being gorgeous with belly side up need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me yet kitty time hack up furballs. Hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser. Sit in box. I bet my nine lives on you-oooo-ooo-hooo shred all toilet paper and spread around the house stare at ceiling, so my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor and meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing. Favor packaging over toy.</p>
