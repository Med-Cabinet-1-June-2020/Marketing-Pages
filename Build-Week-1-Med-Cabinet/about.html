            <p>Nothing in here but back issues of Scientific American. Ooh! I haven't read this one.  I don't want to be our only hope. I crumble under pressure. Let's have another hope. Oh, I brought marshmallows! Occasionally, I am callous and strange.</p>

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! I'm a thing. No argument here. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>

Paddle on both sides let's prioritize the low-hanging fruit. Make it a priority. Collaboration through advanced technlogy bottleneck mice. Gain alignment we need distributors to evangelize the new line to local markets, for bells and whistles, and it's about managing expectations.
